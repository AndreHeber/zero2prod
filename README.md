# Zero2Prod

I'm going through the ebook "Zero to production in Rust" and this is the code for it!

## Makefile.toml

I stumbled over a [Rust tooling article](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2024/02/15/best-rust-tooling), therefore I installed, `cargo-make`, `cargo-audit` and other tools. To run the corresponding tool, look at the `Makefiel.toml` and run `cargo make xxx`!
